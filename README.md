Petition was one of the first projects I created with handlebars. User is able to log in or sign up (with error messages as well if a field does not filled properly) , modify his existing profile, sign the petition ,detete/remake his signature and see all the other users that they already signed the petition (ordered be the city they live as well)![petition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105670853/189531001-d102e5f0-0696-49b9-a950-e292ca5bf7ec.png)
